example note
--

the checkpointing doesn't seem to be quite working (it isn't finding the checkpoint...)
but I can worry about that later when I start training models proper.

I have not done the extension tasks which are all useful and involve manipulating the logs:

You've got all your ouptut, now you want to analyse it. See if you can write code to do the following:

    Find the best model
    Find the worst model!
    Plot the train and test curves for every model fitted
    Implement early stopping in your models - you don't want to keep triaing if your validation loss is not improving
